# size_function.cpp – Dissection

## Purpose
A short summary of what the code does and what concept it demonstrates.

## Required Data/Inputs
List datasets, parameters, or config files the example needs.

## Libraries & Headers
Explain each `#include` and why it’s used.

## Step-by-Step Code Analysis
### 1. Setup and namespace
Explain `using namespace cbl; using namespace cosmology; ...` etc.
### 2. Load data
How is the input catalog loaded? Which class handles it?
### 3. Compute size function
Which CBL functions/classes are involved? What is a size function physically?
### 4. Output results
Where does the result go? File? Console?

## Possible Modifications
Ideas for parameters to change, new datasets to try, or outputs to visualize.

## Python reimplementation plan
Outline how you’d replicate the same logic in `python_re/size_function.py`.

## Julia reimplementation plan
